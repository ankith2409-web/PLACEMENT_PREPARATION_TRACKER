# Placement Prep Tracker

Hey! This is a personal web application I built to track my placement preparation journey. It helps me organize everything in one place—DSA questions, contest performance, core CS subject notes, goals, and aptitude progress.

I built this because tracking preparation across LeetCode, Codeforces, and local notebooks was getting messy. This app provides a unified dashboard and tracks my daily coding streak to keep me motivated!

## Tech Stack I Used

* **Backend**: Python Flask (using Blueprints for modularity and sessions for user auth)
* **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS3 (glassmorphic dark theme, fully responsive), and JavaScript ES6
* **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM (7 tables for users, problems, contests, etc.)
* **Visualizations**: Chart.js (to see graphs of my solved problems by difficulty, category, and goal completion rates)

## Key Modules & Features

1. **Dashboard**: Shows my progress summary cards (total problems solved, active streak, contests attended, and active goals), recent activities, and progress bars.
2. **DSA Tracker**: Log coding questions from LeetCode, GFG, HackerRank, CodeChef, and Codeforces. I can filter them by topic, difficulty, and platform, and search by name.
3. **Contest Logger**: Logs my ranks, rating changes, and delta improvements.
4. **Interview Notes**: A handy notebook for core subjects like OOP, DBMS, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and HR questions with search and category tags.
5. **Goal Board**: Lets me set milestones (e.g. "Solve 50 Tree problems") with deadlines. The app automatically updates their progress.
6. **Daily Streaks**: Keeps track of my daily activity and shows my current coding streak.
7. **Analytics**: Visual graphs (powered by Chart.js) showing solved problems by difficulty, category, and month.
8. **Admin Dashboard**: A special panel to view system-wide stats.

## Database Design

I designed a relational schema using SQLite:
1. `User`: User profiles, password hashes, and streak details.
2. `Problem`: Logged DSA coding questions (platform, difficulty, topic).
3. `Contest`: Logs for contest ranks and ratings.
4. `Goal`: Milestones with target metrics and deadlines.
5. `Note`: Personal subject notes (DBMS, OOP, OS, CN).
6. `ActivityLog`: Log of recent user actions.
7. `AptitudeTopic`: Completion checklist for aptitude modules.

## Git Development Branches

I worked on this project using a structured branch strategy:
* `database`: Configured SQLAlchemy and models.
* `authentication`: Added signup, login, session guard decorators, and profile pages.
* `dsa-tracker`: Added CRUD endpoints for coding questions and contests.
* `notes-manager`: Built notes, goals, and aptitude checklist endpoints.
* `analytics`: Configured Chart.js data API and CSS themes.
* `main`: Consolidated all features and tested integration.
